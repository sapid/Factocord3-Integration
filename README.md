[Mod on the Mod Portal](#) (TODO!)

## Features:

- Log completed research
- Log when a player dies
- Log player joins & leaves
- Log player kicked, muted, banned, etc
- Advertise Evolution % every 15 minutes
- Integration with [Factocord 3](https://github.com/maxsupermanhd/FactoCord-3.0) (enable `have_server_essentials`)

This is a mod that allows the Discord bot [Factocord 3](https://github.com/maxsupermanhd/FactoCord-3.0) to log deaths and research. It's an adaptation of [Factorio-Discord-BotIntegration](https://github.com/oof2win2/Factorio-Discord-BotIntegration).
